# Image-Outlier using Alibi Detect

VAE (Variational Autoencoder) outlier detection using alibi detect is a technique that combines the power of variational autoencoders and the alibi detect library to identify outliers in a given dataset. Outliers are data points that deviate significantly from the expected patterns or distributions in the dataset.

A variational autoencoder is a type of deep learning model that learns to encode and decode input data. It consists of an encoder network that maps the input data to a lower-dimensional latent space and a decoder network that reconstructs the input data from the latent representation. The VAE is trained in an unsupervised manner to reconstruct the input data accurately.

The alibi detect library provides a range of algorithms for outlier detection, including VAE-based methods. These methods leverage the reconstruction capabilities of the VAE to detect data points that are difficult to reconstruct accurately. The underlying intuition is that outliers will have a higher reconstruction error compared to inliers.

The process of VAE outlier detection using alibi detect typically involves the following steps:

Data Preprocessing: The input dataset is preprocessed to ensure it is in a suitable format for training the VAE.

1) Training the VAE: The VAE model is trained on the dataset, optimizing the encoder and decoder networks to accurately reconstruct the input data.

2) Encoding and Reconstruction: The trained VAE is used to encode the input data into a latent space representation, and then decode it back to reconstruct the data.

3) Calculating Reconstruction Error: The reconstruction error is computed by comparing the original input data with its reconstructed counterpart. Various metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) or binary cross-entropy (BCE) can be used to measure the discrepancy.

4) Threshold Estimation: A threshold is determined to distinguish between inliers and outliers based on the reconstruction error distribution. This threshold can be defined using statistical techniques or domain knowledge.

5) Outlier Detection: Finally, the reconstruction error of each data point is compared to the threshold. If the error exceeds the threshold, the corresponding data point is classified as an outlier.
